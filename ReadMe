In short, this code does the following:

- Establishes a remote connection to Wufoo Web API with authentication information
- Receives up to 100 entries from the specified form in JSON format
- Parses the JSON and inserts the data into an Excel spreadsheet formatted with modular headings (via text file)
  for easy insertion into Microsoft Access database.
- Establishes a connection with the Microsoft Access database and performs a series of "INSERT" commands using
  the previously created and populated Excel spreadhseet.
- Gives feedback as to when each process is active and completed, letting the user know how many entries were
  inserted for both user feedback and debugging purposes.
  
Code is commented for more in-depth descriptions on code philosophy and function within "Get Wufoo Data.py".
